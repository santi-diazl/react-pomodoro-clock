# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# freeCodeCamp Pomodoro Clock
A 'Pomodoro' clock written in vanilla JavaScript and SASS as a final project for freeCodeCamp's Front End Development certification. This [demo version](https://sdiaz-pomodoro-clock.netlify.app/) includes freeCodeCamp's test suite and clock will pass all 29 of its required user stories.

 *  Note: Audio user story will not pass on most mobile devices due to mobile browser's restrictions on autoplayed media.
